# Restaurant Order Project
How to test project: run the commandline code "pytest" in root directory.

This project manages restaurant's orders process. Users able to order, Order service will track all orders with their status. Restaurant will have a menu that includes several items. OOP principles has been used in this project. After finished infrastructure of this project, I will integrate fastapi or django to manage http requests. Fastapi is able to create api documentation automatically using swagger. I would prefer it because fo that.
